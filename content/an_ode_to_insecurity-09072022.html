  >im back lol <br>
  >so u know what we are doing today <br>
  >we are talking about insecurity (talking wont exactly be the right word since its mostly me who reads these things) <br>
  >insecurity is what most of us harbor and well its quite natural <br>
  >being intimidated by that guy or girl is totallly normal <br>
  >sometimes we strive to so much perfect that forget who we truly are <br>
  >and in the end insecurity itself is not destructive but having negative thoughts about and trying to impersonate someone else to get a little bit of attention is actually harmful <br>
  >so my advice -  stay who you are and dont be intimidated by some random person in your class whom youve not even talked to <br>
