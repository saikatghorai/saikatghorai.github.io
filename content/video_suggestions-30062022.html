  <u>>>5 video suggestions for you guys!</u><br><br>
  >recently, ive been hooked to videos by nexpo, disrupt and lemmino. <br>
  >honestly, i feel that the quality and amount of effort put into each video by these guys is just unparallel. <br>
  >the content is so much researched into, it just keeps me hooked throughout the whole video. <br>
  >also the topics are mostly unheard of which adds to un-spoiler-ness(?) of the episode. <br>
  >nevertheless, each video is structured in such a way that itll feel more like a story instead of a boring documentary. <br>
  >therefore, i wanna share some videos which im sure youll like. <br> <br> <br>
